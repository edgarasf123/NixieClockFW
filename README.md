:warning::warning:**This project is currently very WIP and doesn't have basic functionalities of a clock!**:warning::warning:

# NixieClockFW

Custom firmware for NCS314 **HW2.0**. The goal of this firmware is to seperate different functions of the clock into seperate modules/files, for easier customization.

# Disclaimer
Do not use with any other hardware version, other than 2.0, as it might possibly cause damage to the shield.
