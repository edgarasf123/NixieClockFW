# NixieClockFW

Custom firmware for NCS314 **HW2.0**. The goal of this project is to make the firmware easy to read, and easy to customize.

Originally I wanted to modify the original firmware of NCS314, but I had hard time to understand the code. I've decided to scrap the idea of modifying the firmware, and decided to write my own.

# Disclaimer

I cannot guarantee this will work with other hardware versions, and I would strongly advise you not to try. Using this firmware with other hardware version(other than HW2.0) might cause damage to the shield.

# TODO

* Menu(Buttons + IR Remote)
* LED Control
* Temperature
* Alarm
* Tone
